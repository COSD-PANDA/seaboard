This dataset includes the City's adopted CIP budgets from fiscal year 2011 to the most current. This data is also visualized in our online budget tool at [budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov/transparency#/).

The CIP budget estimates costs to build and upgrade City infrastructure. Some CIP projects span multiple fiscal years.

Rows in this dataset show budget at the expense account level. Each row includes the corresponding project and fund type information, but additional corresponding information is available in separate reference datasets. [Read our explanation](/budget-topic/) on how to join the reference datasets to the budget datasets.

For the budget that estimates how much the City will spend to fund operations and services, see the dataset for the [Operating budget](/datasets/operating-budget/).
