The census count of vehicles on city streets is normally reported in the form
of Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts.
<!--more-->
These counts provide a good estimate for the actual number of vehicles on
an average weekday at select street segments. Specific block segments are
selected for a count because they are deemed as representative of a larger
segment on the same roadway. ADT counts are used by transportation engineers,
economists, real estate agents, planners, and others professionals for planning
and operational analysis. The frequency for each count varies depending on
City staff’s needs for analysis in any given area. This report covers the counts
taken in our City during the past 12 years approximately.
