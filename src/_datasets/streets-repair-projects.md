Repair and maintenance projects completed on City-maintained streets.

The Transportation Department uses a variety of treatment types based on the [Pavement Condition Index](/datasets/streets-overall-condition-index/) of a street. The treatment types vary from less costly maintenance treatments (e.g. slurry seal, cape seal scrub seal), to more costly repair treatments (e.g. overlay), through the most expensive treatments such as reconstruction. More information on the different treatment types can be found in the [Pavement Management Plan] (https://www.sandiego.gov/transportation/programs/pavement-management-plan).
