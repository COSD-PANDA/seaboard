The City has 9 divisions for the purpose of law enforcement: Central, Northern, Northeastern, Northwestern, Southern, Southeastern, Easter, Western, and Mid-City. Each division is a combination of law beat areas within the division boundary. These are police divisions only and do not represent legal neighborhood or community boundaries.
