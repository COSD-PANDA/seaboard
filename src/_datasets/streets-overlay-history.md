The most recent Asphalt Overlay project performed on each City-maintained street. If a street has not received Asphalt Overlay treatment, original construction date is provided.

Asphalt Overlay consists of installing a new layer of asphalt on top of the existing street surface at a thickness of one to three inches. Streets are ground down (milled) before resurfacing so asphalt will not build up at the edge of the gutter. To learn more about the City's program to maintain streets, view the [Pavement Management Plan](https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/2024-01/pavement-management-plan-report.pdf)
