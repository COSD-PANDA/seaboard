The <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/economic-development/business/financing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">San Diego Regional Revolving Loan Fund</a> operates in San Diego and Chula Vista to provide small business assistance and generate neighborhood commercial district revitalization.
<!--more-->

The fund includes a $1.5 million grant from the Economic Development Administration plus a matching amount from the two cities. The $3 million available to expanding businesses supplements private financing for the acquisition of new or rehabilitated buildings and fixed machinery and equipment, working capital and soft costs.
