The [San Diego Regional Revolving Loan Fund]('https://www.sandiego.gov/economic-development/business/financing/'){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
operates in San Diego and Chula Vista to provide small business assistance
and generate neighborhood commercial district revitalization.
<!--more-->

The fund includes a $1.5 million grant from the Economic Development
Administration plus a matching amount from the two cities. The $3 million
available to expanding businesses supplements private financing for the
acquisition of new or rehabilitated buildings and fixed machinery and equipment,
working capital and soft costs.
