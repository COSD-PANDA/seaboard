The outcome(s) of a stop for a person stopped by the San Diego Police Department. This data is collected according to requirements set forth in Government Code section 12525.5 that was enacted as a result of the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 (AB 953), also known as RIPA.

<!--more-->

The file contains one row per outcome per person stopped by Police. A stop may have more than one outcome. The person stopped is uniquely identified in the `pid` field, and the stop is uniquely identified in the `stop_id` field. These two fields can be used to join this dataset to the other RIPA datasets available at the following links:
