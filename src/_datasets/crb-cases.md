In 2020, voter-approved Measure B created a new independent Commission on Police Practices (CPP) that replaced the Community Review Board on Police Practices (CRB). The CPP independently investigates officer-involved shootings, in-custody deaths, & other significant incidents in a process that is transparent and accountable to the community. The CPP also evaluates SDPD policies, practices, training, and protocols. This dataset includes all cases the CPP reviewed and closed out since the beginning of FY 2020.

The mission of the Commission is to hold law enforcement accountable to the community and to increase community trust in law enforcement, resulting in increased safety for both the community and law enforcement. To learn more, visit [sandiego.gov/cpp/about](https://www.sandiego.gov/cpp/about)

Each case in this dataset is identified by a unique case `id` and case number. A single case may involve multiple allegations, multiple complainants and multiple officers. Each officer named in the complaint is assigned an anonymous person id in the `pid` field that is unique for that case `id`. Complainant, cases and allegations are in separate files that can be joined on the `id` and `case_number` fields. Each complainant named in the complainant file is assigned an anonymous person id in the `complainant_id` field that is unique for that case `id`.

The body worn camera details file included with this dataset lists each officer (`pid`) per complaint and whether that officer had a body worn camera on or off during the incident under review.
