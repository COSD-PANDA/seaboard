The CRB reviews and evaluates complaints against San Diego Police Department officers as well as the administration of discipline from sustained complaints. The Board also reviews all officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths. This dataset includes all cases the Board has finished investigating since the beginning of FY 2018.
