Certificate number and property addresses for active Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) vacation type certificates.
<!--more-->

Properties located in the City of San Diego that are rented to Transients for less than one month are required to obtain a Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate.  This includes short-term residential occupancy properties of any kind (i.e. houses, condos, rooms, or spaces) rented directly by the owner/operator, by property management companies or via internet travel services.  The short-term residential occupancy properties are generally issued a "Vacation" type TOT Certificate.

In general, the data available in this dataset is the same information that is displayed on the TOT Certificate.
