Licenses for Short-term Residential Occupancy in San Diego dwelling units.
<!--more-->

City regulations require a license for all STRO of a dwelling unit, or part thereof, for less than one month within the City of San Diego. Four tiers of licenses are available, depending on the type of dwelling unit, number of days, and location within the Mission Beach Community Planning Area. A host may only hold one license and may not operate more than one dwelling unit for STRO at a time; licenses are not transferrable between ownership or location/dwelling unit.
