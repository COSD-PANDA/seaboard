Whether a person stopped by the San Diego Police Department displayed signs of deafness, speech impairment, blindness, a mental health condition, intellectual or developmental disability, or another disability categorized as "other." This data is collected according to requirements set forth in Government Code section 12525.5 that was enacted as a result of the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 (AB 953), also known as RIPA.

The file contains one row per perceived disability per person stopped by Police. An officer may perceive more than one disability for a person stopped. The person stopped is uniquely identified in the `pid` field, and the stop is uniquely identified in the `stop_id` field. These two fields can be used to join this dataset to the other RIPA datasets available at the following links:
