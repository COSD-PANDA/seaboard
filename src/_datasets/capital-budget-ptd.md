This dataset includes the City's budgeted CIP expenses from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2016. Each fiscal year includes line items for projects from project beginning through that fiscal year. This data is also visualized in our online budget tool at [budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov/transparency#/)

The CIP budget estimates costs to build and upgrade City infrastructure. Some CIP projects span multiple fiscal years.

Rows in this dataset are line item expenses and revenues per project. Each line item includes corresponding project and fund type information, but more corresponding information is available in separate reference datasets. [Read our explanation](../budget-topic.html) on how to join the reference datasets to the budget datasets.

For the budget that estimates how much the City will spend to fund operations and services, see the dataset for the [Operating budget](operating-budget.md).
