This dataset contains transactions between election committees and financial
supporters, including loans, contributions of money, contributions of goods
and services, and money spent independently to support a candidate or ballot measure.
<!--more-->

Transactions come from electronic filings with the City of San Diego Clerk's
office that are required by local and state campaign laws. Committees are
required to report a variety of financial transactions, but the ones included
here come from California Form 460 schedules A, B1, C and D as well as California
Form 496 and California Form 497.
