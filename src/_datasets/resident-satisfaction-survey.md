To promote a customer-focused culture, the City of San Diego conducted a Resident Satisfaction Survey in 2015. The survey assessed satisfaction with the delivery of City programs, services, and City staff and preferences about how City officials should prioritize programs and services.

A total of 2,478 surveys were completed with a 95% level of confidence and a margin of error of +/- 2.0%. Results have a high level of statistical reliability at both the Council district level and the City as a whole, allowing for a precise assessment of resident attitudes towards City services.

The next survey effort is expected to take place in the fall of 2018. For more information, please visit [https://www.sandiego.gov/pad/2015-resident-satisfaction-survey](https://www.sandiego.gov/pad/2015-resident-satisfaction-survey).
