A 2015 citywide Resident Satisfaction survey gathered response data from 2,478 residents. The survey measured attitudes about San Diego as a place to live and work as well as the level of service the City is providing in such areas as libraries, parks, infrastructure, fire, and police. 

The next survey is anticipated to take place in 2018.
