Here are individual test results from the water monitoring database,
plus the monthly totals reported to the state to demonstrate MCL compliance.
This dataset does not include results of tests for chemical parameters.

<!--more-->
Public Utilities currently has 160 sample sites for the City of San Diego drinking
water system and is required to test 85 sites per week. Temperature, chlorine
and pH are measured on site, and then a sample is brought to a lab to test
for the presence of the indicator bacteria coliform and E.coli. Coliform
and the strains of E.coli tested serve as indicators of the presence of
potentially harmful bacteria.

A positive result for coliform from one single test is not enough to constitute
an MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) violation. An acute violation occurs when
a site that initially tested positive is repeat tested and either the initial
sample or one of the repeat samples is positive for E. coli. A monthly MCL
violation occurs if more than 5 percent of all routine and repeat tests
are coliform positive. A positive coliform result from a single routine
test may be due to sampling error or bacteria in the testing mechanism
but not in the drinking water pipes.
