This dataset includes the City's adopted operating budgets from fiscal year 2011 to the most current. This data is also visualized by our online budget tool at [budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov/transparency#/)
<!--more-->
The Operating Budget estimates how much the City will spend to fund operations and services. Rows in this dataset are line item expenses and revenues. Each line item includes the corresponding department and fund type, but more corresponding information is available in separate reference datasets. [Read our explanation](../budget-topic.html) on how to join the reference datasets to the budget datasets.

For the budget that estimates costs to build and upgrade City infrastructure, see the [dataset for the Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) budget](capital-budget-fy).
