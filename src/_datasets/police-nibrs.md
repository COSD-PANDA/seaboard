The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) was implemented in 2021 to improve the overall quality of crime data collected by law enforcement. It captures details on each single crime incident—as well as on separate offenses within the same incident—including information on victims, known offenders, relationships between victims and offenders, arrestees, and property involved in crimes.

This dataset includes information about a relevant case that occured, including date and location of that case, the responding police division, service area, beat and NIBRS specific information including group type, category, who crime was committed against, whether it was a property crime or violent crime and relevant police and NIBRS offense information.

For a detailed description about an offense, see [NIBRS offense codes definitions](https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2011/resources/nibrs-offense-codes)
