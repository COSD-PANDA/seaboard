In 2021, the San Diego Police Department began reporting to the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for statistics. NIBRS collects data on all crimes reported to law enforcement agencies, not just the highest charges within those crimes. Crime categories in NIBRS include crimes against Persons (i.e., assault, homicide, etc.), Property (i.e., burglary, theft, robbery, etc.), and Society (i.e., alcohol and drug offenses, weapon offenses, gambling, etc.). These new categories are a shift from the older FBI reporting style (UCR Summary) of simply reporting violent and property crime counts. For the most part, SDPD’s crime reporting will follow the NIBRS categories now. Historical data will still be posted to the Annual Crime Reports website.
 
This dataset comprises of Crime Offense Data extracted from the San Diego Police Department's Records Management System and includes information such as the date/time of the reported offense, offense category, underlying code sections, and the hundred block address where the incident occurred. This data is dynamic as records are updated daily and may change or be deleted as police investigations proceed. Records range from January 2020 – Present. The [SDPD Neighborhood Crime Summary Dashboard](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/c24d611442564023af92f42759ee5c42/) visualizes this dataset.
 
For more information on NIBRS reporting guidelines please refer to the [FBI's 2021.1 National Incident-Based Reporting System User Manual](https://bjs.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh236/files/sarble/data_common/nibrs-user-manual-2021-1041521.pdf).
