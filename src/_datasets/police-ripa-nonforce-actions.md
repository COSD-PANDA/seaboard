Non-Force-Related Actions an officer took toward a person stopped by the San Diego Police Department. This data is collected according to requirements set forth in Government Code section 12525.5 that was enacted as a result of the Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 (AB 953), also known as RIPA.

The file contains one row per non-force-related action per person stopped by Police. An officer may have taken more than one non-force-related action toward a person. The person stopped is uniquely identified in the pid field, and the stop is uniquely identified in the stop_id field. These two fields can be used to join this dataset to the other RIPA datasets available at the following links:
