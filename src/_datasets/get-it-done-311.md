The <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/get-it-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get It Done program</a> allows residents and visitors to report certain types of non-emergency problems to the City using the Get It Done mobile app, web app, or by telephone. This dataset contains all Get It Done reports the City has received since the program launched in May 2016.
<!--more-->

The scope of this data is limited to information from the reports citizen users submit through Get It Done. The data includes fields for the date and time a report was submitted, what the problem was, the location of the problem, and the date when the user was notified that the City addressed the problem. This data does not include details about any work performed to fix a problem or the date and time work was completed. Reports that are referred outside of the Get It Done system have a status of “Referred”.

Please note that this data includes every user-submitted report and should not be considered an official record of City maintenance work. For example, users might submit problems that have already been reported, that are the responsibility of another government agency or private business, that cannot be found or verified, or that are already scheduled to be fixed in a long-term maintenance plan. The details about how the City addressed each report are outside of the scope of this dataset. 

If you have any questions about this data, please contact <a href="mailto:pandatech@sandiego.gov?subject=Question about Get It Done data">pandatech@sandiego.gov</a>. If you have questions about your Get It Done report, please refer to your confirmation email.
 
Get It Done handles these specific types of non-emergency issues:
<ul>
<li>Parking and vehicles, including violations of the 72-hour parking and oversized vehicle rules</li>
<li>Trash, including a missed trash pickup and illegal dumping</li>
<li>Streets, sidewalks, and lights, including potholes and broken curbs, sidewalks, street lights, traffic signs, and traffic lights</li>
<li>Maintenance of trees on City property</li>
<li>Storm water and drains</li>
</ul>
Get It Done users are also able to make certain types of appointments with the City through the app, but these are not considered reports of non-emergency problems and are not included in this data.
