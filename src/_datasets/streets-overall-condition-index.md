The Pavement Condition Index (PCI) is the most widely used method for assessing and reporting street pavement conditions. The PCI scoring scale ranges from zero (worst) to 100 (best) and provides a common language for pavement practitioners to describe and communicate pavement conditions. PCI scores are used to help the City choose the appropriate maintenance and repair treatment types for each street.

Pavement condition data was not collected for unpaved streets and alleys, streets and alleys under construction at the time of the assessment, or streets and alleys that had obstructions at the time of the assessment.
