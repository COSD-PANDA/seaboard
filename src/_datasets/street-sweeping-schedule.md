This schedule includes the time and date for street sweeping by block.
The City's goal is to sweep residential streets at least once per month
and commercial streets at least once per week.
<!--more-->
Street sweeping removes debris from gutters that may contribute to flooding
and also prevents debris from entering the storm water system and then the ocean.

Also included in this dataset is whether the street sweeping schedule has
signage restricting parking. Some blocks have posted signs restricting parking
during the time and day the street will be swept, and parking citations
will be issued during these times. Other routes have no signs restricting
parking, but residents are asked to voluntarily move their cars for sweeping.
