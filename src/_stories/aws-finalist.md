Our work to automate data updates won us a spot with [16 other finalists](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/tag/city-on-a-cloud-innovation-challenge/) in Amazon's [City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/aws-launches-the-fourth-city-on-a-cloud-innovation-challenge-opens-contest-to-schools/).

Finalists, announced earlier this week, include other governments and schools that are competing in the Best Practices category. This category honors a completed project that focuses on a citizen service, uses Amazon web services, and employs innovative solution that other public entities might be able to use.

The winner will be announced in two weeks and receive $50,000 credits toward Amazon Web Services (AWS).

AWS is crucial to our Data & Analytics program. [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) hosts our data files as well as the Open Data Portal we built for ourselves. [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) helps us display dataset previews on the portal and stream metrics for portal use and dataset downloads into our monitoring tool [Keen](https://keen.io/). [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) allows us to capture real-time data for analytics projects.
