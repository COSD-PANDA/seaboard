As you know by now, our Open Data Portal is hard at work keeping San Diego’s data accessible and up-to-date. As we strive to keep San Diego at the forefront of SmartCity technology, more citizens and city officials continue to recognize the portal’s benefits.  

Our site and team are even turning heads beyond city boundaries! Netlify, an online platform that easily allows users to deploy websites, recently crowned our Open Data Portal the “Netlify Site of the Week.” By using the hassle-free services Netlify offers, we saved the city from spending money on expensive website builders, and saved ourselves from hours of tedious work. We are proud to epitomize “innovation, creativity, and utility,” and join the other sites in Netlify’s hall of fame.
