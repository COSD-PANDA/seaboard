The City of San Diego is not only a smart city, it's a solar friendly city.  Our 2015 <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/sustainability" target="_blank">Climate Action Plan</a> sets an ambitious goal to achieve 100% clean and renewable electricity in the city by 2035. If 2016 is an indicator, we're well on our way to reaching our goals.

Even before City Council passed Mayor Faulconer's Climate Action Plan, our Development Services Department was ahead of the game and began <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/development-services/streamlining-residential-solar-panel-systems-permitting" target="_blank">expediting solar permits</a> several years ago. This is also thanks to supportive <a href="http://energycenter.org/policy/property-assessed-clean-energy-pace" target="_blank"> financing programs such as PACE</a> and other incentives.

Mostly, the 2016 sample of solar you see here is thanks to smart San Diegans doing what's good for their bank account and the environment all at the same time.
