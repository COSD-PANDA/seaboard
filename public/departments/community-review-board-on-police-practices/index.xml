      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Community Review Board on Police Practices, known as the CRB, was established by San Diego voters in 1988 to review and evaluate complaints filed by the public against members of the City of San Diego Police Department. The CRB reviews and evaluates the administration of discipline arising from sustained complaints, all officer-involved shootings, and all in-custody death cases.  In addition, the Board makes recommendations to the Chief of Police regarding the San Diego Police Departmentâ€™s policies and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
