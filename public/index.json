Temperature, chlorine and pH are measured on site, and then a sample is brought to a lab to test for the presence of the indicator bacteria coliform and E.coli. Coliform and the strains of E.coli tested serve as indicators of the presence of potentially harmful bacteria.\nA positive result for coliform from one single test is not enough to constitute an MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) violation. An acute violation occurs when a site that initially tested positive is repeat tested and either the initial sample or one of the repeat samples is positive for E. coli. A monthly MCL violation occurs if more than 5 percent of all routine and repeat tests are coliform positive. A positive coliform result from a single routine test may be due to sampling error or bacteria in the testing mechanism but not in the drinking water pipes.\n",

It has excellent drivability and needs little maintenance or remedial repair. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.\n  Fair - A street in this category has moderate cracking, some minor potholes and has adequate drivability. It is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.\n  Poor - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, and exhibits a rough ride. It qualifies for a comprehensive repair or a total reconstruction – meaning that a street may be replaced from the ground up if conditions warrant that effort.

The City uses center-line miles to describe the distance of our street network. “Repair-miles” are used to describe repair work and account for both the length and width of our streets. Totals for miles paved are in repair miles. This data is displayed on streets.sandiego.gov.\nTypes of street repair  Asphalt Paving / Overlay / Inlay - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1.5 to 3 inches over an old worn-out street surface or by first removing 2 to 3 inches of existing asphalt before a new layer is placed. Concrete - Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels and complete reconstruction of the entire roadway when warranted. Slurry Seal - Slurry sealing repair uses a mixture of sand and an emulsion of petroleum products to coat a street surface up to 3/8 of an inch thick. A slurry seal coating is not a complete resurfacing treatment and is used to preserve and prolong the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and small surface repairs may be conducted before the sealing effort. ",

Specific block segments are selected for a count because they are deemed as representative of a larger segment on the same roadway. ADT counts are used by transportation engineers, economists, real estate agents, planners, and others professionals for planning and operational analysis. The frequency for each count varies depending on City staff’s needs for analysis in any given area. This report covers the counts taken in our City during the past 12 years approximately.\n",
