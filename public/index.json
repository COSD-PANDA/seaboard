     "contents": "Most of the data published on this portal is updated via our automation system, which allows us to provide daily updates to hundreds of files. This would not be possible if we manually updated the data. The other side of this coin is that because we are not manually updating data, we are not manually checking the quality. Things happen to the data that we don\u0026rsquo;t always catch until someone in the community spots the problem and lets us know.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been working on a project to build quality checks into our automation process so that this happens less frequently. As a result of this, we\u0026rsquo;ve had to make some changes across all of our data files, including standardizing field names.\nWe know that changing field names could cause scripts that pull our data to break, so starting June 10, 2019, we are outputting the updated data files with file names that have a version number added to the end. The old files will still be available under the existing file names, but the data will not be updated at that location.\nIf you normally download our data by clicking the little blue arrow button on the dataset pages, then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about this! However, if you ingest our data by making a request via URL, you will need to update your scripts. The links to all of our data files will have \u0026ldquo;_v1\u0026rdquo; appended to indicate they are version 1. If we ever need to make changes to the schemas in the future, we will increase the version number for that data file.\nSome of the quality issues we will be addressing by the end of the project include unexpected missing values, dates that are outside of the temporal coverage for that file, geocodes that are outside of the bounding box for that file, numeric values that are suddenly much higher or much lower than the average or median, and many others. The automation system will alert us when it finds these problems, and we\u0026rsquo;ll look into it and fix it if needed.\n",

     "contents": "When I wrote about how we launched a homemade Open Data portal, I made the claim that a data portal is just a website with a catalog of datasets.\nA few companies sell expensive portal products to governments. These companies take care of hosting the datasets and running that website I’m referring to, where people visit to download the data. Some of these portals also give users limited ability to search, filter, and chart data without downloading it.\nWe wanted to have more control over our portal. We had ideas for how it should look and how it should work. Some of these ideas are included in a piece of guidance the Civic Analytics Network wrote for Open Data programs.\nWe could also save the City of San Diego money, so we figured we would make our own website and find a place to host our datasets. We used a bunch of tools to make accomplishing these simple objectives even easier. What follows is an overview of those tools.\nGithub: Stores our code, allows us to collaborate Our team of three collaborated on content and code for the portal. Our codebase lives in this Github repo. Team members can pull down the code, add to it and change it, then submit the changes where the whole team can review and incorporate them.\nWhen we push to certain Github branches, we trigger Circle CI to deploy a new copy of the site to either staging or production. We use the staging site for internal review, for example when we have a new dataset to publish and need to run it by someone in the owning City department. Once we have production-ready code, that goes live on our server.\nJekyll: static site builder Jekyll is a major tool we use to create the website. With Jekyll, we can put content into a mix of different file types — HTML, Markdown, YAML — and easily compile them all into a static website. We don’t require a database backing up our site, and we don’t have to have a Content Management System like WordPress.\nCircle CI: Deploys our code Circle CI makes deployment simpler and reduces potential for human error. Circle CI deploys to Amazon S3. Depending upon which Github branch we push to, Circle CI can figure out whether to deploy to our staging site or our production site.\nAmazon S3: Hosts our content Amazon S3 hosts our portal in two buckets: 1. The bucket for our static site files, and 2. The bucket for our dataset files. This way, each dataset has its own url that developers can build applications off of, knowing that the data will always be updated there and it won’t suddenly become unavailable if the City’s network or the portal go down for some reason.\nCloudfront: Serves our static site Amazon’s Cloudfront distributes our static site content to each of multiple servers across the world, also known as Edges. So, when a user visits our portal from China, for example, she is routed to a server closest to her, making the portal experience faster.\nLambda \u0026amp; Polymer: Create data previews Our datasets are updated often, some daily. But we needed a way to provide a fresh preview of the data each time a user visits a dataset page. We also didn’t want to load the entirety of a large dataset onto the page, because that would be slow.\nOur solution was to use a Polymer component built into the template of our dataset pages. It makes a request with the URL of the dataset as a parameter. A Lambda function picks the request up, goes to S3, streams the first 10 rows and returns them as JSON. Then the Polymer component displays the resulting JSON.\nKeen: Monitors data updates and tracks portal usage Lambda makes another appearance here. We have a function that checks log files in our Amazon buckets and sends information to Keen.io. We then use Keen to track specific events of interest taken out of the log information, like when a dataset is uploaded, or when someone visits a page on the portal.\nWe use Keen’s API to put metrics for daily dataset updates on the portal homepage. But that’s just the beginning.\nWe offer this overview because we want you to be able to copy our work. Open source code is important to us — after all, our work IS taxpayer funded. Please, visit our Github repo where you can copy our data portal and use it as a basis for your own. But know that copying those files is only part of the work involved. Knowledge of the extra tools and processes will help you get the job done.\n",

     "contents": "Be honest. When you read the words data automation you get a sudden rush of melatonin to your brain, your eyelids get heavy, and you get an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep. Don\u0026rsquo;t be ashamed; you are reacting to these words in a similar manner to 99.5% of people on the planet. Bear with me though for just a few paragraphs while I try to explain why it matters, and how we do it here at the City of San Diego.\nBefore we get started, let me promise to not use any of the following:\n Mathematics (or any subset thereof) Buzzwords Tech Jargon  The Quick Win One of the best case studies to make obvious the benefits of data automation is StreetsSD. We started working on this project with the City\u0026rsquo;s Transportation and Stormwater Department (TSW). They asked us to build a map of paving projects. We got a spreadsheet of data from the department, loaded it into our mapping tool and wrote some code. Boom, we had a map.\nThe Ugly Loss Most web maps, charts, and data visualizations you see in newspapers, and even those created by a lot of cities, usually stop there. That\u0026rsquo;s actually OK because a lot of these things don\u0026rsquo;t need to be updated automatically. However, the goal of StreetsSD is to provide an up-to-date status of work to city employees and residents. Keeping the map updated is important.\nThe typical City approach in these situations is to have someone \u0026ldquo;run a report\u0026rdquo; and upload it somewhere to update the map. Most of the time, \u0026ldquo;running a report\u0026rdquo; actually means this:\n Extract data from a database, using a query (that could change, resulting in different data). Complete 1-40 manual steps in Excel to clean the data. These steps are usually not documented anywhere and could easily vary for each run of the report. Send it or upload it somewhere.  This approach inherently has several problems:\n Data is inconsistent, meaning source of truth is inconsistent Bad data potentially causes bugs in the application City employees waste a HUGE amount of time People might forget to actually run the report We can\u0026rsquo;t expect someone to run a report every day (or with any kind of frequency that a continously update data source needs).  Needless to say, this sucks. And even though we\u0026rsquo;re creating a great operational tool, we\u0026rsquo;re costing people time and risking the release of wrong information.\nAt this point, being the wise reader you are, you might be thinking that the outcome would definitely be worth the cost in the case of just one map. To which I\u0026rsquo;ll respond with:\nThis is not a problem with just one map. It would occur with any dataset we provide as open data on the portal, anything we build on top of those datasets, and any internal or external reports we regularly generate. Therefore, this is a problem that needs to be solved at a systemic level.\nRedemption Our philosophy has always been to let machines do what they do best - updating data, re-running things, keeping track of things - and humans do what they do best - making those fuzzy decisions that only our brains can.\nWe needed a flexible and extensible solution that could scale across the organization as a whole.\nWe turned to an open source project called Airflow. It has become the tool of choice for Spotify, IFTTT, Lyft, AirBnB and many others for solving this exact set of problems. Airflow has several advantages:\n Built in Python - so it\u0026rsquo;s extensible with any of thousands of Python open-source packages Modular - new connections to different data sources are easy to write Open source with a strong community - so there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of support and continuous updates Scalable - as we need to do more and more, Airflow easily scales  We called our Airflow deployment Poseidon because codenames are cool, San Diego is on the Ocean, and Poseidon rules the sea. Plus, we get to use images like these: The basic idea of Poseidon is this:\n Get data from a source (database, spreadsheet, map, website) Do some stuff to it (geocode it, aggregate it, clean it) Upload it (put it on the cloud that is backing our portal and a variety of other applications) Run it on a schedule (once every 5 minutes, OR once every day, OR on every odd day of the month at 3:02 PM)  Simple, right?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re now doing this for all of our datasets (way harder to implement than explain). This means we\u0026rsquo;re also doing it for everything built on top of our data, such as StreetsSD, the portal, and various other visualizations.\nThe Open Sea Now you\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking: whoop-de-doo, I\u0026rsquo;m a resident and I don\u0026rsquo;t know data, so I really don\u0026rsquo;t care that you now have automated data.\nWe know. That\u0026rsquo;s why we pushed it further.\nLook back at the diagram above. Those are just dependent pieces that run in a defined cycle. What if we flipped out some of those pieces and got this?\nAutomated data is now starting to get interesting. Because of Poseidon\u0026rsquo;s flexibility, and the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of coordinated tasks, we can send automatic notifications, alerts based on thresholds, and all kinds of other cool stuff that would never have been possible without automation.\nBut if I told you what we were planning next, I\u0026rsquo;d ruin the surprise. You\u0026rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.\n",

     "contents": "Hey San Diego! Your open data portal just got a LOT faster!\nOne of the reasons we wanted to run our own data portal is the flexibility we have to change it and add functionality.\nToday, we\u0026rsquo;re putting the pedal to the metal on those desires. We initially launched the portal based on JKAN, but with modified schemas, layouts, and branding. Because of how fast we moved, we put off thinking about speed and performance.\nSince the dust settled a bit, we had a chance to do that.\nLighthouse is a tool developed by Google to test web pages for performance, accessibility, and more. The first time we ran it against our portal, here\u0026rsquo;s what we got: See full report\n30 out of 100, with a lot of marks against the portal due to loading speed. Time to first paint is a metric that measures when the primary content of a page is visible. That number means it took 5.3 seconds after you navigated to the portal for anything to show up.\nWe did badly on plenty of other metrics, including SSL encryption (HTTPS) and offline browsing.\nSo why does this matter (besides our obsessive perfectionism)? KissMetrics has a great infographic about this:\nIn short, we were losing an estimated 25 percent of portal users because of the page loading speed. Not good.\nMy friend and former Code for America co-fellow David Leonard (who also got me into Polymer components that the portal heavily uses ) helped me analyze where the bottlenecks were in our page loading time and gave me some tips about how to speed up the portal.\nWe implemented https and service workers (for security and offline browsing and caching) and optimized how components load. The portal is now encrypted, and you can browse it offline.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to go into too much detail, but you can see the pull request here. We tested again and got a score of 96:\nSee full report\nLet me use a few buzzwords to describe what happened here, for those fond of them:\nWe used an agile process to iterate on the technology underlying the performance, availability, and scalability of our portal architecture to decrease page loading speed, increase cybersecurity, and improve an already great product with enhanced user experience.\nOr in English:\nWe did a thing that most organizations do: we improved something we launched, because no one ever gets everything right the first time. We\u0026rsquo;ll do it again, and again, and again. This is just the first of many changes and enhancements we will be making.\nEnjoy your [faster] portal, San Diego!\n",

     "contents": "StreetsSD was an interesting project us from an organizational and technical perspective. Let\u0026rsquo;s peek behind the scenes to see how this all came together.\nOverall Architecture Jekyll Overall, StreetsSD is a Jekyll site. This allows us to avoid maintenance costs, performance issues, and complexity associated with running database-driven sites. We host it using Github Pages for the wonderful price of $0.\nEverything you see outlined in pink above is Jekyll and custom JS. We used the San Diego Style Guide for colors and layouts. The charts on the bottom, the layers, and the text in the explainer boxes are controlled by the views.yml in the repo.\nAll the dynamic components you see from the layers (FY14, FY15, etc) to the charts and totals are populated through custom SQL queries against data in Carto. They are constructed using the squel library in the sqlBuilder file.\nAs an example, when you click on the \u0026ldquo;Work in FY-2016\u0026rdquo; layer, an event is sent that constructs and sends the query to Carto to display results on a map. Based on the views.yml file, we know that layer has WorkType and WorkByMonth charts, so one more query is constructed and sent to Carto. After additional JS data processing, we are able to display the charts.\nCarto The interactive map itself is all Carto. Most of the visual components (e.g. line styles, legends, hovers) are stored in Carto as well. We don\u0026rsquo;t love that, because those should be stored in code, but we have an issue on the backlog to address it.\nThe map in Carto has two \u0026ldquo;layers\u0026rdquo; - one for OCI and one for Streetwork, both based off sdstreets_query table. Carto\u0026rsquo;s model for associating layers to datasets ties them together permanently. By having a virtual dataset that we can impose queries on, we are eliminating the tie between a dataset and a map, giving us more flexibility to flip out the underlying datasets if we need to change schemas.\nThen why two layers from one table? Because OCI layers and streetwork layers have slightly different fields and labels. Carto\u0026rsquo;s interactive UI is tied to a layer, and we had to separate the two. Then, we impose the queries on the layer accordingly. We can probably condense this to one layer using more advanced conditional logic, but we\u0026rsquo;ll stay away from that for now.\nDeployment We use the master branch as the bleeding edge. That gets deployed to a staging site continuously by CircleCI. The production branch gets deployed to the gh-pages branch, which is what feeds StreetsSD. We get notifications about each step.\nDatasets #####cg_streets_combined We created this dataset by merging the City\u0026rsquo;s official street file geographies with essential data from the City\u0026rsquo;s Pavement Management System. Every other set of data is joined against cg_streets_combined by segment_id to derive the geometries and street names.\n#####sd_paving_datasd This is the full work layer, encompassing work done from the beginning of FY14. We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about the specifics in the data delivery section. This has no geospatial data. As layers get selected, SQL is generated, applied to this layer, and joined against cg_streets_combined.\n#####oci_2011_datasd and oci_2015_datasd\nThese were created using historical data provided in the Pavement Management System and the new OCI numbers we received from latest run of the most recent vendor. These also have no geospatial data. As layers get selected, SQL is generated, applied to this layer, and joined against cg_streets_combined.\nData Discovery We partnered with the Transportation and Storm Water Department to build the map. However, we quickly ran into some challenges with understanding the data, and the calculations performed for reporting.\nThe PVM (let\u0026rsquo;s use that as the acronym for the Pavement Management System) is an application that is built on top of SQL server using queries and stored procedures. Every month, the streets team has to update IMCAT. IMCAT is a system the City uses to coordinate street work across departments. This way we can avoid the same segment being dug up multiple times in a short time span. The streets team pull a report from the PVM generated by a query and a stored procedure). Then, it\u0026rsquo;s manually cleaned in Excel (we counted 32 steps), joined with a streets shapefile, and uploaded it to IMCAT.\nThis is where we started. The data that gets uploaded to IMCAT has to be in a particular format with certain columns, so we couldn\u0026rsquo;t directly trace that dataset to the query running against PVM. And we couldn\u0026rsquo;t just guess the query and match the result either - PVM has 319 tables.\nA few months ago, the City invested in a tool called Alation exactly for this type of use case. We wanted to be able to maintain data catalogs and keep documentation on the data that we have, allowing data users to be better informed. This database is the first one we connected with Alation.\nWe built a robust query to continuously pull data. To do this, we used Alation to trace the query the PVM application was running. However, we had no visibility into the stored procedure. To bypass this, we combined information from using the query, the streets team and Alation\u0026rsquo;s query logs.\nQuery Log Tables Table Internal View + Our Notes Built Query for Paving Data Built Query for Street Info Going through this process gave us an enormous amount of knowledge of street paving information, which we have documented in Alation.\nHowever, we weren\u0026rsquo;t done yet. We still needed to build the ETL for Street Map Data, IMCAT data (because friends don\u0026rsquo;t let friends clean data over and over manually), and the CG_STREETS_COMBINED file.\nData Delivery We have two main queries that pull data without doing much cleaning. We wanted to stay away from cleaning in SQL as a best practice.\nstreets_base gets pulled by FME, combined with the geospatial base file, and outputs as a shapefile to S3. Carto syncs it down from there:\nR pulls Pavement Ex in using Alation\u0026rsquo;s API and the Alation R Package, completes the 32 manual steps the department normally has to do (with some conditional forks for IMCAT), and then outputs the sd_paving_datasd.csv file into S3. We also make sure to standardize the outgoing data according to our Technical Guidelines. At the same time, we output the IMCAT file to be ingested for the conflict mitigation map.\nVerifying Calculations So, how in the world do we know that our constructed SQL on the client side is doing the right thing and making the right calculations? We use R to verify that the calculations are correct by pulling the data straight from Alation, and duplicating the calculations that the SQL does on Streets Map.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next? This is an alpha project, and we plan to continue working on it. We will work in sprints As people submit feature or bug requests, we will prioritize them according to what we think we can do during the time allotted. Critical bugs always get fixed first.\nOf course, we are more than open to Pull Requests. If there is a feature you really want and we\u0026rsquo;re just unable to get to it, feel free to discuss it with us in the issue queues, fork the code, and make a Pull Request.\n",

Temperature, chlorine and pH are measured on site, and then a sample is brought to a lab to test for the presence of the indicator bacteria coliform and E.coli. Coliform and the strains of E.coli tested serve as indicators of the presence of potentially harmful bacteria.\n How To Interpret The Results  A value of \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; under coliform and/or E.coli means \u0026ldquo;absence,\u0026rdquo; or that the latest test at that site was negative for indicator bacteria. A value of \u0026ldquo;P\u0026rdquo; means presence.\nA positive result for coliform from one single test is not enough to constitute an MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) violation. An acute violation occurs when a site that initially tested positive is repeat tested and either the initial sample or one of the repeat samples is positive for E. coli. A monthly MCL violation occurs if more than 5 percent of all routine and repeat tests are coliform positive. A positive coliform result from a single routine test may be due to sampling error or bacteria in the testing mechanism but not in the drinking water pipes.\n{% include story-embed.html col-md=\u0026quot;12\u0026rdquo; url=\u0026quot;https://cityofsandiego.carto.com/u/cityofsandiego-admin/viz/a8a34894-3d6b-11e6-b5f8-0ecd1babdde5/embed_map\u0026rdquo;%}\n",

Sweeping removes debris that might clog the the storm water system and cause flooding and prevents harmful particles from entering the ocean. If the block you\u0026rsquo;re parked on has signage restricting parking during a certain day and time for street sweeping, you could get a ticket when the sweeper goes by.\nThe best thing to do is check for signs before you park, but this guide will give you an overview of street sweeping in general, and where you might get a ticket.\nAn overview of street sweeping schedules As of the last revision of the street sweeping schedules in March 2015, more than 27,000 city blocks were part of the street sweeping program. Just under two-thirds of streets are scheduled to be swept one day out of the week every other month, either in odd months or even months. The remaining streets are swept monthly, at a frequency ranging from one day out of the month to every day between both sides of the street.\n{% include story-embed.html col-md=\u0026quot;12\u0026rdquo; url=\u0026quot;https://plot.ly/~andrell81/22/number-of-city-streets-by-street-sweeping-frequency/\u0026rdquo; %}\nKnowing the sweeping schedule of your own street is important so you can move your car (enter your address into the map just below, and click on your street to get the schedule) and help the City keep the streets clean, regardless of whether you\u0026rsquo;d get a ticket if you didn\u0026rsquo;t. But if you want to avoid getting a ticket when you\u0026rsquo;re out and about in other areas of San Diego, the maps below give you an idea of where signs are posted restricting parking.\nWhere signs are posted versus not posted About 90 percent of City blocks that are swept do not have a sign posted to restrict parking during street sweeping. For those blocks (the blue ones on the map) residents should do their part to help the environment and move their cars, although they won't be ticketed if they don't. The remaining 9 percent or so (in orange) do have signs posted that restrict parking during street sweeping, and any parked cars could be ticketed.\nSome of the areas with posted signs include Downtown, Mission Beach, Ocean Beach, La Jolla, and North Park.\n{% include story-embed.html col-md=\u0026quot;12\u0026rdquo; url=\u0026quot;https://cityofsandiego.carto.com/u/cityofsandiego-admin/viz/906f8c01-f459-4c04-a63d-da14f48a489f/embed_map\u0026rdquo; %}\nStreets swept weekly Out of the blocks with posted signs (displayed below), about 1,300 have street sweeping scheduled weekly. The majority of those have one or two days where sweeping could take place, but some have as many as five days of possible sweeping between both sides of the street. With the exception of Mission Boulevard, streets downtown have the busiest sweeping schedules. The good news about Downtown is that the sweeping is mostly scheduled for between 3 and 6 a.m. Mission Boulevard is swept between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.\n{% include story-embed.html col-md=\u0026quot;12\u0026rdquo; url=\u0026quot;https://cityofsandiego.carto.com/u/cityofsandiego-admin/viz/454b8824-cd47-4c72-8f80-9c02c9c32b1c/embed_map\u0026rdquo; %}\nStreets swept every other week  North Park and La Jolla residents have to remember to park carefully four specific days out of the month. Some of these blocks have sweeping scheduled on the same day of the week, and other blocks have sweeping scheduled on a Monday one week and on a Tuesday the next week. This schedule is especially tricky during months that begin on a Tuesday. For example, in November 2016, the second and fourth Mondays are in different weeks than the second and fourth Tuesdays. {% include story-embed.html col-md=\u0026quot;12\u0026rdquo; url=\u0026quot;https://cityofsandiego.carto.com/u/cityofsandiego-admin/viz/7bd9e870-3741-11e6-83ca-0ea31932ec1d/embed_map\u0026rdquo; %}\nNeed more help? If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you probably still manage to mess up sometimes and be that lone car parked on the block during street sweeping, often with a little yellow envelope on your windshield.\nMobile apps and messaging services exist to alert people to street sweeping schedules when they park. One option is to sign up for alerts through Sweeping Alerts. Another option is an app called Spot Angels.\n",

If 2016 is an indicator, we\u0026rsquo;re well on our way to reaching our goals.\nEven before City Council passed Mayor Faulconer\u0026rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, our Development Services Department was ahead of the game and began expediting solar permits several years ago. This is also thanks to supportive financing programs such as PACE and other incentives.\nMostly, the 2016 sample of solar you see here is thanks to smart San Diegans doing what\u0026rsquo;s good for their bank account and the environment all at the same time.\n{% include story-embed.html col-md=\"12\" url=\"https://cityofsandiego.carto.com/u/cityofsandiego-admin/viz/08a24cf0-80eb-11e6-b5c2-0e3ebc282e83/embed_map\"%}  {% include story-embed.html col-md=\"6\" url=\"https://plot.ly/~MrMaksimize/329.embed\"%} {% include story-embed.html col-md=\"6\" url=\"https://cityofsandiego.carto.com/u/cityofsandiego-admin/viz/d57f77ff-c375-4ec0-bf4d-de79fe6ecf36/embed_map\"%} ",

A few examples include crime counts, parking meter revenue, traffic counts and capital projects. Right now, this data is kept in a number of different places and formats.\nIf data repositories could be integrated and easily accessed, understanding of civic activity and policy will deepen. Transparency and accountability will increase. And the City will become a more efficient and data-driven leader in the global civic landscape.\nOpening up data would help staff and policymakers to make decisions, allow City employees to share information and empower residents to conduct analyses and build applications on top of the City’s data.\nOpen data program goals ###Increase data literacy within the City and with those who interact with the City\nLevels of understanding vary on the definitions of data, metadata and Open Data. We also plan to provide City staff with tools for data analysis and visualization.\n###Manage data as an asset by formalizing existing oversight and ownership\nWe can create a robust data management program by building on and formalizing existing data management and responsibility structures. This way, we can help City staff avoid data duplication and rework and ensure sustainability of Open Data release.\n###Release data to the public via a strategic and predictable process\nData releases must account for a multitude of factors, including communicating with data owners, confirming data integrity, removing personally identifiable information (PII), and describing and releasing data in a way that meets Open Format specifications.\n###Ensure that data are well-described and catalogued\nUnderstanding what data we have is crucial to both Open Data and data management. We worked with departments to create an initial inventory, and now we need to provide processes for keeping it current.\n###Support increased use of data in decision making, as well as innovations in Open Data use\nWe have a talented City workforce that makes data-enabled decisions every day. In addition, fostering and expanding interest in government data among residents and other users is crucial to realizing the benefits of an Open Data program.\nHow did Open Data come to San Diego?

     "contents": "The City\u0026rsquo;s annual budget allocates or appropriates expenses and revenues for each fiscal year. Budget items related to City operations and services are found in the Operating Budget. Budget items related to building and upgrading City infrastructure are found in the Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) Budget.\nCitizens have a few ways of viewing the budget:\n Read a PDF of the published budget document with narratives at sandiego.gov/fm Interact with charts and graphs via an online budget tool at budget.sandiego.gov Download the datasets published on this portal. The datasets you can download here include the same data that is uploaded to the online budget tool.  Checking budgeted amounts against actual dollars spent is part of the budget process. For this reason, we also have available Operating Actuals and CIP Actuals. These datasets are in the same format as their budget counterparts.\nEach dataset is at the account level. This means that each row in the dataset represents an expense or revenue account, and includes a dollar amount, an expense or revenue account number and name, and a fund type and fund number to categorize and specify the funding repository. Operating budget is further separated by a funds center number, indicating an organizational unit within a department, and the name of the responsible department. Capital budget is further separated by the department that owns the project (asset owning department).\nThe information available in the datasets is meant to help data users be able to look through the data and know a little bit about each revenue or expense at-a-glance. However, anyone who wants to analyze the data should consider pulling in additional variables, or columns, that are available in some reference datasets we have also published.\nFunds Fund number and fund type are included in both the capital and operating datasets. You can get a fund description by joining the fund_number column for either of those datasets with fund_number in the Funds reference dataset.\nDepartments The Departments reference dataset has the same department name column that is available in the Operating Budget dataset, but it also includes the department group, division, section, and funds center. The funds center represents the lowest level of organizational detail within a department. Department group, name, division, and section represent groupings of funds centers. Join on funds_center_number.\nThe hierarchy in this reference dataset is dept_group \u0026gt; dept_name \u0026gt; dept_division \u0026gt; dept_section \u0026gt; funds_center.\nAccounts The account number and name is already available in the capital and operating budgets and is as low-level as you can get it. But, if you want to roll up items, you can join on account_number with the Accounts reference dataset. The hierarchy here is account_type \u0026gt; account_class \u0026gt; account_group \u0026gt; account.\nProjects In the capital budgets, two project variables are already included: the project department, also known as the asset-owning department, and the project name. But by joining on project_number with the Projects reference dataset, you can roll the account up from name to type of project, or asset type. Putting asset-owning department aside, the hierarchy for the remaining columns is asset_type \u0026gt; asset_subtype \u0026gt; project_name.\n",

Temperature, chlorine and pH are measured on site, and then a sample is brought to a lab to test for the presence of the indicator bacteria coliform and E.coli. Coliform and the strains of E.coli tested serve as indicators of the presence of potentially harmful bacteria.A positive result for coliform from one single test is not enough to constitute an MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) violation. An acute violation occurs when a site that initially tested positive is repeat tested and either the initial sample or one of the repeat samples is positive for E. coli. A monthly MCL violation occurs if more than 5 percent of all routine and repeat tests are coliform positive. A positive coliform result from a single routine test may be due to sampling error or bacteria in the testing mechanism but not in the drinking water pipes.\n",

A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.- Fair - A street in this category has moderate cracking, some minor potholes and has adequate drivability. It is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.- Poor - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, and exhibits a rough ride.

     "contents": "Repair projects include City streets that have been repaired since July 1, 2013 (first full fiscal year comprehensive street repair data is readily available) and those that are currently scheduled for repair.\nAs of 2015, the City of San Diego’s street network consists of approximately 3,000 miles of streets as measured along their center-lines, the majority of which are asphalt streets. The City uses center-line miles to describe the distance of our street network. “Repair-miles” are used to describe repair work and account for both the length and width of our streets. Totals for miles paved are in repair miles. This data is displayed on streets.sandiego.gov.\nTypes of street repair- Asphalt Paving / Overlay / Inlay - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1.5 to 3 inches over an old worn-out street surface or by first removing 2 to 3 inches of existing asphalt before a new layer is placed. - Concrete - Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels and complete reconstruction of the entire roadway when warranted. - Slurry Seal - Slurry sealing repair uses a mixture of sand and an emulsion of petroleum products to coat a street surface up to 3/8 of an inch thick. A slurry seal coating is not a complete resurfacing treatment and is used to preserve and prolong the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and small surface repairs may be conducted before the sealing effort.",

Specific block segments are selected for a count because they are deemed as representative of a larger segment on the same roadway. ADT counts are used by transportation engineers, economists, real estate agents, planners, and others professionals for planning and operational analysis. The frequency for each count varies depending on City staff’s needs for analysis in any given area. This report covers the counts taken in our City during the past 12 years approximately.\n",
