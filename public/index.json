     "contents": "   Open Data is a valuable resource meant for everyone. But let’s face it – using data is difficult, and using it correctly is even more difficult. Our goal is to empower all San Diego residents, from the most techy savvy to the least, to get and use the City’s data.\nWe want to help our users by removing the roadblocks we have run into ourselves as data users. The first roadblock might be knowing how to use this data portal effectively. In this tutorial, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how the portal is organized, how to search for what you want, and how to access the data once you\u0026rsquo;ve found it.\nWhat this portal contains The main feature of this portal is a catalog of City data. The catalog contains hundreds of downloadable files, most of which are in a tabular format that can be opened in spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel.\nEach of these downloadable files - called resources - has rows and rows of records. A record could be the transaction that occurs when a single business pays the City Treasurer for its license, or a record could be an incident that the Police responded to. A payment transaction and a police incident are very different events, so each of the records for those events will have different details. For example, one will have the name of the business as a detail, and one will have a name of a street where a public safety incident occurred. These details fill out the columns in the downloadable files.\nFiles with many rows can start to get large and difficult to work with. For this reason, the same kinds of records might be divided into multiple files according to year. Or, we may create a secondary file that aggregates the individual records into counts or sums by day or month. Files with the same kinds of records are grouped into a collection, called a dataset. The list of datasets is what you\u0026rsquo;ll see if you browse data in the catalog, but know that any given dataset may have many resources.\nHow the portal is organized To organize our data, we follow the Catalog \u0026gt; Dataset \u0026gt; Resource model briefly described above. This model is the standard for government open data portals and is published by the World Wide Web Consortium.\nCatalog The portal’s catalog is essentially a list of datasets.\nDataset A dataset is a bucket for multiple views and formats of a single set of data, as well as a place to provide data dictionaries. Each of those permutations and formats is a resource, and all resources are linked from the same dataset page.\nResources Resources are the actual files, APIs or links that we are sharing. We only provide resources that are machine-readable and in an open format. Resource types include:\n csv json geojson zip txt xml API  Organizing the data into resources contained in datasets allows us to offer the same data in different formats or at different granularities.\nData dictionaries If you need help interpreting the field descriptions, each resource has a corresponding dictionary available for download or preview from within the dataset.\nHow to navigate the portal Available datasets To view all the datasets currently available, navigate to the home page, and click on the Browse Catalog menu tab at the top of the page.\nSearching With the search bar on the homepage, users can search for data based on keywords in the dataset title or the name of the publishing City department. Simply click on the Find Data search field, and key in your desired search term.\nHave more questions? Vist our Frequently Asked Questions page.\n",

Excel, Google Docs, LibreOffice Calc or any plain text editor will open files with this format.\n  Shapefile is a common format for geospatial vector and raster data. It was developed by a mapping software company, but most mapping tools can open shapefiles, including QGIS, Google Earth, CartoDB, and Mapbox Studio.\n  Geobuf is a compact binary encoding for GeoJSON data created by Mapbox. These pbf files load more quickly onto a web map than their GeoJSON versions because they are smaller. You will need two JavaScript libraries created by Mapbox to decode geobuf: the geobuf library and the pbf library.\n  GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation.

Temperature, chlorine and pH are measured on site, and then a sample is brought to a lab to test for the presence of the indicator bacteria coliform and E.coli. Coliform and the strains of E.coli tested serve as indicators of the presence of potentially harmful bacteria.\nA positive result for coliform from one single test is not enough to constitute an MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) violation. An acute violation occurs when a site that initially tested positive is repeat tested and either the initial sample or one of the repeat samples is positive for E. coli. A monthly MCL violation occurs if more than 5 percent of all routine and repeat tests are coliform positive.

It has excellent drivability and needs little maintenance or remedial repair. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.\n  Fair - A street in this category has moderate cracking, some minor potholes and has adequate drivability. It is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.\n  Poor - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, and exhibits a rough ride. It qualifies for a comprehensive repair or a total reconstruction – meaning that a street may be replaced from the ground up if conditions warrant that effort.

     "contents": "Repair projects include City streets that have been repaired since July 1, 2013 (first full fiscal year comprehensive street repair data is readily available) and those that are currently scheduled for repair.\nAs of 2015, the City of San Diego’s street network consists of approximately 3,000 miles of streets as measured along their center-lines, the majority of which are asphalt streets. The City uses center-line miles to describe the distance of our street network. “Repair-miles” are used to describe repair work and account for both the length and width of our streets. Totals for miles paved are in repair miles. This data is displayed on streets.sandiego.gov.\nTypes of street repair  Asphalt Paving / Overlay / Inlay - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1.5 to 3 inches over an old worn-out street surface or by first removing 2 to 3 inches of existing asphalt before a new layer is placed. Concrete - Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels and complete reconstruction of the entire roadway when warranted. Slurry Seal - Slurry sealing repair uses a mixture of sand and an emulsion of petroleum products to coat a street surface up to 3/8 of an inch thick. A slurry seal coating is not a complete resurfacing treatment and is used to preserve and prolong the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and small surface repairs may be conducted before the sealing effort. ",
