     "contents": "The City\u0026rsquo;s annual budget allocates or appropriates expenses and revenues for each fiscal year. Budget items related to City operations and services are found in the Operating Budget. Budget items related to building and upgrading City infrastructure are found in the Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) Budget.\nCitizens have a few ways of viewing the budget:\n Read a PDF of the published budget document with narratives at sandiego.gov/fm Interact with charts and graphs via an online budget tool at budget.sandiego.gov Download the datasets published on this portal. The datasets you can download here include the same data that is uploaded to the online budget tool.  Checking budgeted amounts against actual dollars spent is part of the budget process. For this reason, we also have available Operating Actuals and CIP Actuals. These datasets are in the same format as their budget counterparts.\nEach dataset is at the account level. This means that each row in the dataset represents an expense or revenue account, and includes a dollar amount, an expense or revenue account number and name, and a fund type and fund number to categorize and specify the funding repository. Operating budget is further separated by a funds center number, indicating an organizational unit within a department, and the name of the responsible department. Capital budget is further separated by the department that owns the project (asset owning department).\nThe information available in the datasets is meant to help data users be able to look through the data and know a little bit about each revenue or expense at-a-glance. However, anyone who wants to analyze the data should consider pulling in additional variables, or columns, that are available in some reference datasets we have also published.\nFunds Fund number and fund type are included in both the capital and operating datasets. You can get a fund description by joining the fund_number column for either of those datasets with fund_number in the Funds reference dataset.\nDepartments The Departments reference dataset has the same department name column that is available in the Operating Budget dataset, but it also includes the department group, division, section, and funds center. The funds center represents the lowest level of organizational detail within a department. Department group, name, division, and section represent groupings of funds centers. Join on funds_center_number.\nThe hierarchy in this reference dataset is dept_group \u0026gt; dept_name \u0026gt; dept_division \u0026gt; dept_section \u0026gt; funds_center.\nAccounts The account number and name is already available in the capital and operating budgets and is as low-level as you can get it. But, if you want to roll up items, you can join on account_number with the Accounts reference dataset. The hierarchy here is account_type \u0026gt; account_class \u0026gt; account_group \u0026gt; account.\nProjects In the capital budgets, two project variables are already included: the project department, also known as the asset-owning department, and the project name. But by joining on project_number with the Projects reference dataset, you can roll the account up from name to type of project, or asset type. Putting asset-owning department aside, the hierarchy for the remaining columns is asset_type \u0026gt; asset_subtype \u0026gt; project_name.\n",

A few examples include crime counts, parking meter revenue, traffic counts and capital projects. Right now, this data is kept in a number of different places and formats.\nIf data repositories could be integrated and easily accessed, understanding of civic activity and policy will deepen. Transparency and accountability will increase. And the City will become a more efficient and data-driven leader in the global civic landscape.\nOpening up data would help staff and policymakers to make decisions, allow City employees to share information and empower residents to conduct analyses and build applications on top of the City’s data.\nOpen data program goals ###Increase data literacy within the City and with those who interact with the City\nLevels of understanding vary on the definitions of data, metadata and Open Data. We also plan to provide City staff with tools for data analysis and visualization.\n###Manage data as an asset by formalizing existing oversight and ownership\nWe can create a robust data management program by building on and formalizing existing data management and responsibility structures. This way, we can help City staff avoid data duplication and rework and ensure sustainability of Open Data release.\n###Release data to the public via a strategic and predictable process\nData releases must account for a multitude of factors, including communicating with data owners, confirming data integrity, removing personally identifiable information (PII), and describing and releasing data in a way that meets Open Format specifications.\n###Ensure that data are well-described and catalogued\nUnderstanding what data we have is crucial to both Open Data and data management. We worked with departments to create an initial inventory, and now we need to provide processes for keeping it current.\n###Support increased use of data in decision making, as well as innovations in Open Data use\nWe have a talented City workforce that makes data-enabled decisions every day. In addition, fostering and expanding interest in government data among residents and other users is crucial to realizing the benefits of an Open Data program.\nHow did Open Data come to San Diego?

     "contents": "Use this map of the sampling sites where the City\u0026rsquo;s Public Utilities Department tests for indicator bacteria.\nPublic Utilities currently has 160 sample sites for the City of San Diego drinking water system and is required to test 85 sites per week. Temperature, chlorine and pH are measured on site, and then a sample is brought to a lab to test for the presence of the indicator bacteria coliform and E.coli. Coliform and the strains of E.coli tested serve as indicators of the presence of potentially harmful bacteria.\nHow To Interpret The Results A value of \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; under coliform and/or E.coli means \u0026ldquo;absence,\u0026rdquo; or that the latest test at that site was negative for indicator bacteria. A value of \u0026ldquo;P\u0026rdquo; means presence.\nA positive result for coliform from one single test is not enough to constitute an MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) violation. An acute violation occurs when a site that initially tested positive is repeat tested and either the initial sample or one of the repeat samples is positive for E. coli. A monthly MCL violation occurs if more than 5 percent of all routine and repeat tests are coliform positive. A positive coliform result from a single routine test may be due to sampling error or bacteria in the testing mechanism but not in the drinking water pipes.\n ",

     "contents": "The City\u0026rsquo;s street sweeping schedule might not be the first thing on your mind when you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a parking spot - unless you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten one of those parking tickets.\nThe City aims to sweep commercial streets about once per week, and residential streets at least once per month. Sweeping removes debris that might clog the the storm water system and cause flooding and prevents harmful particles from entering the ocean. If the block you\u0026rsquo;re parked on has signage restricting parking during a certain day and time for street sweeping, you could get a ticket when the sweeper goes by.\nThe best thing to do is check for signs before you park, but this guide will give you an overview of street sweeping in general, and where you might get a ticket.\nAn overview of street sweeping schedules As of the last revision of the street sweeping schedules in March 2015, more than 27,000 city blocks were part of the street sweeping program.\nJust under two-thirds of streets are scheduled to be swept one day out of the week every other month, either in odd months or even months. The remaining streets are swept monthly, at a frequency ranging from one day out of the month to every day between both sides of the street.\n  Knowing the sweeping schedule of your own street is important so you can move your car (enter your address into the map just below, and click on your street to get the schedule) and help the City keep the streets clean, regardless of whether you\u0026rsquo;d get a ticket if you didn\u0026rsquo;t. But if you want to avoid getting a ticket when you\u0026rsquo;re out and about in other areas of San Diego, the maps below give you an idea of where signs are posted restricting parking.\nWhere signs are posted versus not posted About 90 percent of City blocks that are swept do not have a sign posted to restrict parking during street sweeping. For those blocks (the blue ones on the map) residents should do their part to help the environment and move their cars, although they won\u0026rsquo;t be ticketed if they don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe remaining 9 percent or so (in orange) do have signs posted that restrict parking during street sweeping, and any parked cars could be ticketed.\nSome of the areas with posted signs include Downtown, Mission Beach, Ocean Beach, La Jolla, and North Park.\n  Streets swept weekly Out of the blocks with posted signs (displayed below), about 1,300 have street sweeping scheduled weekly. The majority of those have one or two days where sweeping could take place, but some have as many as five days of possible sweeping between both sides of the street. With the exception of Mission Boulevard, streets downtown have the busiest sweeping schedules.\nThe good news about Downtown is that the sweeping is mostly scheduled for between 3 and 6 a.m. Mission Boulevard is swept between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.\n  Streets swept every other week North Park and La Jolla residents have to remember to park carefully four specific days out of the month. Some of these blocks have sweeping scheduled on the same day of the week, and other blocks have sweeping scheduled on a Monday one week and on a Tuesday the next week. This schedule is especially tricky during months that begin on a Tuesday. For example, in November 2016, the second and fourth Mondays are in different weeks than the second and fourth Tuesdays.\n  Need more help? If you\u0026rsquo;re like me, you probably still manage to mess up sometimes and be that lone car parked on the block during street sweeping, often with a little yellow envelope on your windshield.\nMobile apps and messaging services exist to alert people to street sweeping schedules when they park. One option is to sign up for alerts through Sweeping Alerts. Another option is an app called Spot Angels.\n",

In addition, the Board makes recommendations to the Chief of Police regarding the San Diego Police Department’s policies and procedures.\nThis dataset includes all cases the CRB reviewed and closed out since the beginning of FY 2019, identified by a unique case ID. A single case may involve multiple allegations and multiple officers. Each row in this data represents one allegation and finding per officer in the complaint. Each officer named in the complaint is assigned an anonymous person id in the pid field that is unique for that case ID.The body worn camera details file included with this dataset lists each officer (pid) per complaint and whether that officer had a body worn camera on or off during the incident under review.\n",

     "contents": "   Open Data is a valuable resource meant for everyone. But let’s face it – using data is difficult, and using it correctly is even more difficult. Our goal is to empower all San Diego residents, from the most techy savvy to the least, to get and use the City’s data.\nWe want to help our users by removing the roadblocks we have run into ourselves as data users. The first roadblock might be knowing how to use this data portal effectively. In this tutorial, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how the portal is organized, how to search for what you want, and how to access the data once you\u0026rsquo;ve found it.\nWhat kinds of information can I find on this portal?  The main feature of this portal is a catalog of City data. The catalog contains hundreds of downloadable files, most of which are in a tabular format that can be opened in spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel.\nEach of these downloadable files - called resources - has rows and rows of records. A record could be the transaction that occurs when a single business pays the City Treasurer for its license, or a record could be an incident that the Police responded to. A payment transaction and a police incident are very different events, so each of the records for those events will have different details. For example, one will have the name of the business as a detail, and one will have a name of a street where a public safety incident occurred. These details fill out the columns in the downloadable files.\nFiles with many rows can start to get large and difficult to work with. For this reason, the same kinds of records might be divided into multiple files according to year. Or, we may create a secondary file that aggregates the individual records into counts or sums by day or month. Files with the same kinds of records are grouped into a collection, called a dataset. The list of datasets is what you\u0026rsquo;ll see if you browse data in the catalog, but know that any given dataset may have many resources.\nHow the portal is organized To organize our data, we follow the Catalog \u0026gt; Dataset \u0026gt; Resource model briefly described above. This model is the standard for government open data portals and is published by the World Wide Web Consortium.\nCatalog The portal’s catalog is essentially a list of datasets.\nDataset A dataset is a bucket for multiple views and formats of a single set of data, as well as a place to provide data dictionaries. Each of those permutations and formats is a resource, and all resources are linked from the same dataset page.\nResources Resources are the actual files, APIs or links that we are sharing. We only provide resources that are machine-readable and in an open format. Resource types include:\n csv json geojson zip txt xml API  Organizing the data into resources contained in datasets allows us to offer the same data in different formats or at different granularities.\nData dictionaries If you need help interpreting the field descriptions, each resource has a corresponding dictionary available for download or preview from within the dataset.\nHow to navigate the portal Available datasets To view all the datasets currently available, navigate to the DataSD home page, and click on the Browse Data menu tab at the top of the page.\nSearching With the search bar on the homepage, users can search for data based on keywords in the dataset title or the name of the publishing City department. Simply click on the Find Data search field, and key in your desired search term.\nIf you have a topical keyword in mind, try using this to find a dataset by title. Below is an instructional video guide, in which we:\n Conduct a sample search for the dataset Get It Done (311) Filter the results to include only those related to Potholes Preview the results on the screen Download the data as a CSV file    If you don’t have a topical keyword in mind but have a good idea which City department publishes the data, try searching for that department.

Temperature, chlorine and pH are measured on site, and then a sample is brought to a lab to test for the presence of the indicator bacteria coliform and E.coli. Coliform and the strains of E.coli tested serve as indicators of the presence of potentially harmful bacteria.A positive result for coliform from one single test is not enough to constitute an MCL (Maximum Contaminant Level) violation. An acute violation occurs when a site that initially tested positive is repeat tested and either the initial sample or one of the repeat samples is positive for E. coli.

It has excellent drivability and needs little maintenance or remedial repair. A street in good condition has an OCI rating between 70 and 100.- Fair - A street in this category has moderate cracking, some minor potholes and has adequate drivability. It is typically in need of remedial repairs and a slurry seal. A street in fair condition has an OCI rating between 40 and 69.- Poor - A street in this category has severe cracking, numerous areas of failed pavement with possible sub base failure, and exhibits a rough ride. It qualifies for a comprehensive repair or a total reconstruction – meaning that a street may be replaced from the ground up if conditions warrant that effort. A street in poor condition has an OCI rating between 0 and 39.\n",

The City uses center-line miles to describe the distance of our street network. “Repair-miles” are used to describe repair work and account for both the length and width of our streets. Totals for miles paved are in repair miles. This data is displayed on streets.sandiego.gov.\nTypes of street repair- Asphalt Paving / Overlay / Inlay - Placement of a new layer of asphalt at a thickness of 1.5 to 3 inches over an old worn-out street surface or by first removing 2 to 3 inches of existing asphalt before a new layer is placed. - Concrete - Repairs to concrete streets range from patching with asphalt to removal and replacement of isolated concrete panels and complete reconstruction of the entire roadway when warranted. - Slurry Seal - Slurry sealing repair uses a mixture of sand and an emulsion of petroleum products to coat a street surface up to 3/8 of an inch thick. A slurry seal coating is not a complete resurfacing treatment and is used to preserve and prolong the state of asphalt pavements in ‘fair’ to ‘good’ condition. As part of this process, crack sealing and small surface repairs may be conducted before the sealing effort.",
