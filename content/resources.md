### What do I do if I find a problem with the data published here? {# class="mt-5 mb-3" }

If you think a dataset has an error, please [let us know](mailto:data@sandiego.gov).

### How do I use the various file types? {# class="mt-5 mb-3" }

Data on this portal will be one of the following file types:

- CSV is tabular data. Excel, Google Docs, [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)</a> Calc or any plain text editor will open files with this format.

- Shapefile is a common format for geospatial vector and raster data. It was developed by a mapping software company, but most mapping tools can open shapefiles, including [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/), [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/), [CartoDB](https://carto.com/signup/), and [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/).

- Geobuf is a compact binary encoding for GeoJSON data created by Mapbox. These pbf files load more quickly onto a web map than their GeoJSON versions because they are smaller. You will need two JavaScript libraries created by Mapbox to decode geobuf: the [geobuf library](https://github.com/mapbox/geobuf) and the [pbf library](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf).

- GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation. [Learn More](https://geojson.io).

- TopoJSON extends GeoJSON to encode topology. GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes, based on JavaScript Object Notation. [Learn more](https://github.com/topojson/topojson).


### What do I do if I can't find the data I need in the catalog? {# class="mt-5 mb-3" }

The portal doesn't yet have everything we will publish. We're working on it as outlined in the City's Open Data Policy. The [Data Inventory Dataset](/datasets/data-inventory/) has our schedule.

You may also be looking for data that belongs to another agency or that complements the data we offer on this portal. The list below has some other places to find data. If we don't have something you think we should include, please [let us know](mailto:data@sandiego.gov)!

### How can I request City data that isn't published here? {# class="mt-5 mb-3" }

The [California Public Records Act](http://ag.ca.gov/publications/summary_public_records_act.pdf) gives citizens the right to request government records. The City of San Diego has made the process easier by offering a way to [request records online](http://sandiego.nextrequest.com/). You can also search previous requests for documents that have already been released.
