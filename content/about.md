San Diego's Open Data Portal is an archive containing all of our collected 
data sets openly accessible to the public. Managed by the Performance and Analytics Department, the many City of San Diego departments have come together to be transparent about the data they collect, how they use it, and how it impacts their policies and procedures. The goal of this data portal is to use this technology to be open, accessible, efficient, and transparent regarding data, and to allow citizens to be more connected to the government.
