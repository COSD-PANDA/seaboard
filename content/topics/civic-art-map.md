Managed by the City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture, the Civic Art Collection has grown since 1909 to include paintings, sculptures, works on paper and prints that are exhibited primarily in the working environments of municipal buildings. The Civic Art Collection is further distinguished by integrated artworks in the Cityâ€™s libraries, parks, public safety facilities, civic buildings and other public spaces throughout San Diego.
