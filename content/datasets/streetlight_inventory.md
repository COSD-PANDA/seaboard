The City has more than 60,000 outdoor lights, which include streetlights, pedestrian lighting, sports lighting, parking lot lighting and specialty lighting, the majority of which are Induction lights that emit an energy efficient broad spectrum light source. This dataset includes coordinates for each light.

An upcoming installation of 3,200 specialty sensors will allow the City to collect environmental data, such as temperature, pressure, lightning, compass, humidity, vibration, and noise. Visual sensors can provide added benefits to enhance parking and traffic optimization, public safety, and pedestrian and mobility planning. Additional expansion ports are available. This deployment is one of the largest Internet of Things deployments by a City government. An additional 14,000 more energy efficient LED fixtures will be installed with specialized Adaptive Control  systems that can send notifications for maintenance.
