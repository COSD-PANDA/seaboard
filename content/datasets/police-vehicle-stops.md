Vehicle stops made by the San Diego Police Department between 2014 and June 26, 2018. For stops made after June 26, 2018, please see the [Police RIPA Stops dataset](/datasets/police-ripa-stops/).

<!--more-->

For 2014 - 2016, all vehicle stops are contained in one file. Stops occuring during 2017 and 2018 (through June 26) are divided into two files: one that matches the format of previous years, and one that matches the format of a new database the department began using in October 2017. Stop IDs are only unique within each file.

In certain cases, a search is conducted following a vehicle stop. To get information on any searches Police conducted, as well as the outcome of the stop, refer to the accompanying [search details datasets](/datasets/police-vehicle-stops-search-details/).
