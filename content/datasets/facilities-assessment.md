More than 700 City facilities have been assessed for current and anticipated maintenance and capital needs. Each facility was given an FCI rating. This rating offers an idea of the overall building condition and takes into account the cost of the backlog for both maintenance and capital needs.

Facility assessments included buildings, as well as select equipment installed in buildings and other systems on the building site.
