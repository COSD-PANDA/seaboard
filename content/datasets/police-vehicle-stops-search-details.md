Details on searches conducted during vehicle stops as well as outcomes for stops made by the San Diego Police Department between 2014 and June 26, 2018. For stops made after June 26, 2018, please see the [Police RIPA Stops datasets](/datasets/police-ripa-stops/).

<!--more-->

Search details can be joined to the [main vehicle stops](/datasets/police-vehicle-stops/) data using a common `stop_id` field. A single `stop_id` could occur multiple times in the details datasets if Police took more than one action following a stop.
