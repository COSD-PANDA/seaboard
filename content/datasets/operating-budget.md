This dataset includes the City's operating budgets from fiscal year 2011 to the most current. This data is also visualized by our online budget tool at [budget.sandiego.gov](https://budget.sandiego.gov/transparency#/).
<!--more-->The Operating Budget allocates funding throughout the City to fund operations and services. Rows in this dataset show budget at the expense or revenue account level. Each row includes the corresponding department and fund type, but additional corresponding information is available in separate reference datasets. [Read our explanation](/budget-topic/) on how to join the reference datasets to the budget datasets.For the budget that estimates costs to build and upgrade City infrastructure, see the dataset for the [Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) budget](/datasets/capital-budget-fy/).
