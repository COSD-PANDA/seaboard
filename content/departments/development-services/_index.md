{{% bodycopy %}} The department has transformed the way permits are historically processed by converting to an electronic permitting system in place of paper plans, offering virtual counter services and inspections. This transition is an integral part of the City's commitment to #DigitalDSD, an internal initiative to modernize and digitalize all workplace systems, digitize over 8-million records, and leverage technology to increase productivity and improve service delivery to customers. {{% /bodycopy %}}
